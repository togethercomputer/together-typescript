If she could rule this gun-man, as Venters had called him, if she could even keep him from shedding blood, what strategy to play his flame and his presence against the game of oppression her churchmen were waging against her? Never would she forget the effect on Tull and his men when Venters shouted Lassiter's name. If she could not wholly control Lassiter, then what she could do might put off the fatal day. \n\nOne of her safe racers was a dark bay, and she called him Bells because of the way he struck his iron shoes on the stones.

The story of the reindeer who saves Christmas is beloved among children and adults alike. \n\nThe Rankin-Bass animated film production company used Japanese puppets and stop motion to tell the tale, bolstered by a soundtrack featuring Burl Ives' rendition of the theme song. \n\nIn the story, Santa's reindeer Donner and his wife have a son, Rudolph, who has the distinction of a nose that glows. He runs away after being made to feel an outcast and links up with an elf who dreams of becoming a dentist and an adventurer seeking silver and gold. \n\nAfter ending up on the Island of Misfit Toys and wandering for a while, Rudolph goes on to save his loved ones from the Abominable Snow Monster and guides Santa through a blizzard that threatens to ruin Christmas. \n\nIn 2006, the New York Times reported that fans drove for miles to see the Rudolph and Santa Claus puppets at the Center for Puppetry Arts in Atlanta. The pair were thought to be the last of the surviving production puppets.

THE INTERRUPTED MASS \n\nThe morning of that Wednesday of Corpus Christi, fateful to all concerned in this chronicle, dawned misty and grey, and the air was chilled by the wind that blew from the sea. The chapel bell tinkled out its summons, and the garrison trooped faithfully to Mass. \n\nPresently came Monna Valentina, followed by her ladies, her pages, and lastly, Peppe, wearing under his thin mask of piety an air of eager anxiety and unrest. Valentina was very pale, and round her eyes there were dark circles that told of sleeplessness, and as she bowed her head in prayer, her ladies observed that tears were falling on the illuminated Mass-book over which she bent. And now came Fra Domenico from the sacristy in the white chasuble that the Church ordains for the Corpus Christi feast, followed by a page in a clerkly gown of black, and the Mass commenced. \n\nThere were absent only from the gathering Gonzaga and Fortemani, besides a sentry and the three prisoners. Francesco and his two followers. \n\nGonzaga had presented himself to Valentina with the plausible tale that, as the events of which Fanfulla's letter had given them knowledge might lead Gian Maria at any moment to desperate measures, it might be well that he should reinforce the single man-at-arms patrolling the walls. Valentina, little recking now whether the castle held or fell, and still less such trifles as Gonzaga's attendance at Mass, had assented without heeding the import of what he said. \n\nAnd so, his face drawn and his body quivering with the excitement of what he was about to do, Gonzaga had repaired to the ramparts so soon as he had seen them all safely into chapel. The sentinel was that same clerkly youth Aventano, who had read to the soldiers that letter Gian Maria had sent Gonzaga. This the courtier accepted as a good omen.

{"messages":[{"content":"Read the story and extract answers for the questions.\nStory: An incandescent light bulb, incandescent lamp or incandescent light globe is an electric light with a wire filament heated to a high temperature, by passing an electric current through it, until it glows with visible light (incandescence). The hot filament is protected from oxidation with a glass or quartz bulb that is filled with inert gas or evacuated. In a halogen lamp, filament evaporation is prevented by a chemical process that redeposits metal vapor onto the filament, extending its life. The light bulb is supplied with electric current by feed-through terminals or wires embedded in the glass. Most bulbs are used in a socket which provides mechanical support and electrical connections. \n\nIncandescent bulbs are much less efficient than most other types of electric lighting; incandescent bulbs convert less than 5% of the energy they use into visible light, with standard light bulbs averaging about 2.2%. The remaining energy is converted into heat. The luminous efficacy of a typical incandescent bulb is 16 lumens per watt, compared with 60 lm\/W for a compact fluorescent bulb or 150 lm\/W for some white LED lamps. Some applications of the incandescent bulb deliberately use the heat generated by the filament. Such applications include incubators, brooding boxes for poultry, heat lights for reptile tanks, infrared heating for industrial heating and drying processes, lava lamps, and the Easy-Bake Oven toy. Incandescent bulbs typically have short lifetimes compared with other types of lighting; around 1,000 hours for home light bulbs versus typically 10,000 hours for compact fluorescents and 30,000 hours for lighting LEDs.","role":"system"},{"content":"What is the energy source for an incandescent bulb?","role":"user"},{"content":"a wire filament","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Is it hot?","role":"user"},{"content":"yes","role":"assistant"},{"content":"How does it get hot?","role":"user"},{"content":"by passing an electric current through it","role":"assistant"},{"content":"How is is protected?","role":"user"},{"content":"with a glass or quartz bulb that is filled with inert gas or evacuated.","role":"assistant"},{"content":"How about in a halogen bulb?","role":"user"},{"content":"a chemical process","role":"assistant"},{"content":"How does the bulb get its energy supply?","role":"user"},{"content":"by feed-through terminals or wires embedded in the glass.","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Are incandescent lights efficient?","role":"user"},{"content":"no","role":"assistant"},{"content":"How much energy do they convert to light?","role":"user"},{"content":"less than 5%","role":"assistant"},{"content":"What happens to the rest of the energy?","role":"user"},{"content":"it is converted into heat","role":"assistant"},{"content":"How many lumens per watt does an incandescent bulb create?","role":"user"},{"content":"16","role":"assistant"},{"content":"What about a fluorescent bulb?","role":"user"},{"content":"60 lm\/W","role":"assistant"},{"content":"An LED bulb?","role":"user"},{"content":"150 lm\/W","role":"assistant"},{"content":"What are other uses of incandescent bulbs?","role":"user"},{"content":"incubators, brooding boxes for poultry, heat lights for reptile tanks","role":"assistant"},{"content":"How long does an incandescent bulb last?","role":"user"},{"content":"around 1,000 hours","role":"assistant"},{"content":"What about fluorescent?","role":"user"},{"content":"10,000 hours","role":"assistant"},{"content":"And LED?","role":"user"},{"content":"30,000","role":"assistant"}]}

{"messages":[{"content":"Read the story and extract answers for the questions.\nStory: Poultry (\/\u02ccpo\u028altri\u02d0\/) are domesticated birds kept by humans for the eggs they produce, their meat, their feathers, or sometimes as pets. These birds are most typically members of the superorder Galloanserae (fowl), especially the order Galliformes (which includes chickens, quails and turkeys) and the family Anatidae, in order Anseriformes, commonly known as \"waterfowl\" and including domestic ducks and domestic geese. Poultry also includes other birds that are killed for their meat, such as the young of pigeons (known as squabs) but does not include similar wild birds hunted for sport or food and known as game. The word \"poultry\" comes from the French\/Norman word poule, itself derived from the Latin word pullus, which means small animal. \n\nThe domestication of poultry took place several thousand years ago. This may have originally been as a result of people hatching and rearing young birds from eggs collected from the wild, but later involved keeping the birds permanently in captivity. Domesticated chickens may have been used for cockfighting at first and quail kept for their songs, but soon it was realised how useful it was having a captive-bred source of food. Selective breeding for fast growth, egg-laying ability, conformation, plumage and docility took place over the centuries, and modern breeds often look very different from their wild ancestors. Although some birds are still kept in small flocks in extensive systems, most birds available in the market today are reared in intensive commercial enterprises. Poultry is the second most widely eaten type of meat globally and, along with eggs, provides nutritionally beneficial food containing high-quality protein accompanied by a low proportion of fat. All poultry meat should be properly handled and sufficiently cooked in order to reduce the risk of food poisoning.","role":"system"},{"content":"When was poultry first domesticated?","role":"user"},{"content":"several thousand years ago.","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Why might people have kept quail in captivity before using them for nourishment?","role":"user"},{"content":"for their songs","role":"assistant"},{"content":"What about chickens?","role":"user"},{"content":"for cockfighting","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Are today's chickens virtually the same as their ancestors?","role":"user"},{"content":"no","role":"assistant"},{"content":"What did breeders look for when breeding?","role":"user"},{"content":"fast growth, egg-laying ability, conformation, plumage and docility","role":"assistant"},{"content":"How can one avoid food poisoning when eating poultry?","role":"user"},{"content":"by properly handling and sufficiently cooking","role":"assistant"},{"content":"How is the term poultry defined?","role":"user"},{"content":"domesticated birds kept by humans for the eggs they produce, their meat, their feathers, or sometimes as pets.","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Are pidgeons considered poultry?","role":"user"},{"content":"yes","role":"assistant"},{"content":"What are they sometimes alternatively called?","role":"user"},{"content":"squabs","role":"assistant"},{"content":"From which language is \"poultry\" derived?","role":"user"},{"content":"the French\/Norman word poule","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Which means?","role":"user"},{"content":"small animal","role":"assistant"},{"content":"In what language originally?","role":"user"},{"content":"Latin","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Which scientific order includes both chickens and turkeys?","role":"user"},{"content":"Galliformes","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Which is a subcategory of which superorder?","role":"user"},{"content":"Galloanserae","role":"assistant"},{"content":"How are most birds raised today?","role":"user"},{"content":"in intensive commercial enterprises.","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Globally, where does poultry rank as a meat source?","role":"user"},{"content":"second","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Are chickens and eggs a high source of fat?","role":"user"},{"content":"no","role":"assistant"},{"content":"What nuitritonal benefit do they have?","role":"user"},{"content":"they contain high-quality protein","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Originally, where did people find birds to raise?","role":"user"},{"content":"eggs collected from the wild","role":"assistant"}]}

Its economic status was formalized in membership of Comecon from 1949, and its defense status in the Warsaw Pact of May 1955.

In 1989, as Marxist\u2013Leninist governments and communism were ending all over Europe, Czechoslovaks peacefully deposed their government in the Velvet Revolution; state price controls were removed after a period of preparation. In 1993, Czechoslovakia split into the two sovereign states of the Czech Republic and Slovakia. \n\n\n\nThe country was of generally irregular terrain.

Humor has been evaluated by many great minds such as Thomas Hobbes, who, in \"On Nature\", disliked humor, \"Laughter is nothing else but sudden glory arising from sudden thought of feeling far better than others.\" He thought humor to be a negative quality of human narrow-mindedness. \n\nHowever, Mordechai Gordon, Ph. D of Education, insists, \"Humor allows us to view the world from an angle that is amusing rather than serious.\" I agree with Gordon. Learning to look at the world through humor is important. \n\nIn the United States, every four years an election occurs. Without humor as a way to express their feelings, how else would Americans keep from clawing their eyes out and going the way of lemming? Television shows like \"The Daily Show\" have become important parts of American culture. They are mothering the masses by metaphorically airplane-ing politics into our mouths. They make politics fun. \n\nOf course, politics is only one type of humor. Social humor helps people through the twists and turns of the human condition. American pop culture promotes an unhealthy self- image. On the topic of self-image, Hari Kondabolu stands out. He has a joke about the popular musical group \"The Pussycat Dolls\", describing their hit song \"Don't Cha\" as a negative representation of women. He points out an obvious offence in American culture. \n\nA study from Loyola University of Maryland has shown that humor is one determining factor for selecting a mating partner. Amongst other things, mates look for an outstanding funny bone in a potential partner. \n\nOf course, humor is not always used for good purposes. Humor can be linked to vulgarity and racism, but, like everything else, it has potential to unite human beings by allowing us to laugh at ourselves, our failures and our connection with one another. \n\nThough 1ife may seem tough and depressing at times, all I have to do is look in the mirror at my increased wrinkles to know that there is a comedy out there that even Chaplin wasn't aware of. \n\nWith that in mind, remember to laugh with humanity and sometimes at humanity.","role":"system"},{"content":"Is humor important in the opinion of the author?","role":"user"},{"content":"yes","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Where was the study done showing we look for humor when dating?","role":"user"},{"content":"Loyola University","role":"assistant"},{"content":"What is mirrored by a culture?","role":"user"},{"content":"its humor.","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Who didn't like humor?","role":"user"},{"content":"Thomas Hobbes","role":"assistant"},{"content":"What did he think it was?","role":"user"},{"content":"a negative quality of human narrow-mindedness","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Who said it helps us see things less seriously?","role":"user"},{"content":"Mordechai Gordon","role":"assistant"},{"content":"When do we elected politicians in America?","role":"user"},{"content":"every four years","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Is laughter important in this process?","role":"user"},{"content":"Yes","role":"assistant"},{"content":"What television show provides an outlet for this?","role":"user"},{"content":"\"The Daily Show\"","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Who jokes about a song?","role":"user"},{"content":"Hari Kondabolu","role":"assistant"},{"content":"What is it's name","role":"user"},{"content":"\"Don't Cha\"","role":"assistant"},{"content":"By whom?","role":"user"},{"content":"\"The Pussycat Dolls\",","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Is humor only used to help?","role":"user"},{"content":"No","role":"assistant"},{"content":"What is something less than positive that may appear there?","role":"user"},{"content":"representation of women","role":"assistant"},{"content":"What might it be linked to?","role":"user"},{"content":"vulgarity and racism","role":"assistant"},{"content":"What does the author see in his reflection?","role":"user"},{"content":"increased wrinkles","role":"assistant"},{"content":"What do they tell him?","role":"user"},{"content":"That there is a comedy in everything.","role":"assistant"},{"content":"And what should we chuckle at besides ourselves?","role":"user"},{"content":"our failures and connection with one another.","role":"assistant"}]}

Several of the region's universities (notably the University of Rochester and Rochester Institute of Technology) have renowned research programs. In addition, Rochester is the site of many important inventions and innovations in consumer products. The Rochester area has been the birthplace to such corporations as Kodak, Western Union, Bausch & Lomb, Gleason and Xerox that conduct extensive research and manufacturing in the fields of industrial and consumer products. Until 2010, the Rochester metropolitan area was the second-largest regional economy in New York State, according to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, after the New York City metropolitan area. Rochester's GMP has since ranked just below that of Buffalo, New York, while still exceeding it in per-capita income. \n\nThe 25th edition of the \"Places Rated Almanac\" rated Rochester as the \"most livable city\" in 2007, among 379 U.S. metropolitan areas.

Available wherever e-books are sold, Goldsher's insta-book costs just $1.99. \n\nAccording to Digital Book World, fast-thinking authors have already churned out least seven e-books, all about the humble and wholesome Harvard graduate.

But for the three guns fired so opportunely from the Foudroyant, the execution could not have been stayed; and but for a prudent care on the part of the master's-mate, the guns would never have been fired. The explanation is this: when Cuffe was giving his subordinate instructions how to proceed, the possibility of detention struck the latter, and he bethought him of some expedient by which such an evil might be remedied. At his suggestion then, the signal of the guns was mentioned by the captain, in his letter to the commander-in-chief, and its importance pointed out. When Clinch reached the fleet, Nelson was at Castel \u00e0 Mare, and it became necessary to follow him to that place by land.

{"messages":[{"content":"Read the story and extract answers for the questions.\nStory: Every day Yang Hongwei takes the bus home from work, staring silently at the European-style villas , luxury cars and twinkling lights from the shopping center that he sees through the window. \n\nYang works for a software company in Zhongguancun. He dreams of such a life, away from poverty, and that hope has kept him in Beijing for three years since he graduated from university. \n\nSoon Yang squeezes his way off the bus to the reality of his life: his home--a 10-square-metre room that costs 550 yuan(81 US dollars) or about one-fifth of his salary in rent every month. It's very cold inside the house as it has no central heating system. He has to stand the long and cold winter. Determined to achieve his dream, Yang says he has changed jobs \"numerous\" times in the past three years and is considering quitting his present job. \n\nYang's frustration over his life as a migrant is shared by many other graduates that have moved into big cities. Together they have come to be called the \"ant tribe\", a term created by Chinese sociologists to describe the struggles of young migrants, who, armed with their diplomas, flood to big cities in hopes of a better life only to put up with low-paying jobs and poor living conditions. They share every similarity with ants. They live in colonies in crowded areas. They're intelligent and hardworking, yet unknown and underpaid. The term, sociologists have said, also reflects their helplessness in a world governed by the law of the concrete jungle--only the strongest survive. \n\nA survey in Ant TribeII found nearly 30 percent of the \"ants\" are graduates of famous key universities--almost three times the percentage of 2009. Most have degrees in popular majors, such as medicine, engineering, economics and management. In addition, 7.2 percent of the \"ants\" have at least a master's degree compared to 1.6 percent in 2009. Most said the economic recovery did not really improve their financial situations, and 66 percent said their incomes fell short of their expectations, the survey also found. \n\nFor two years, Lian Si, a post-doctoral fellow at the Center for Chinese and Global Affairs of Peking University, who has studied the phenomenon, led a team of more than 100 graduate students to follow the groups in university towns like Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan and Xi'an. Lian evaluates the total population of the \"ant community\" in major cities at one million across China, with about 100,000 found in Beijing alone. Lian predicts that an increasingly challenging job market will see the ant tribe growing further in number. Another 6.3 million graduates are expected to join migrant workers and other job hunters in what promises to be a fierce labour competition. \n\nThe ant tribe's embarrassing living situations have become a serious social issue, and the government should develop \"second-and-third-tier cities\" to attract more graduates from big cities. However, \"ants\" expect more study and training opportunities in big cities, which keeps them in positive mindsets despite their situations. As in the case of Yang, he is optimistic about getting a new job soon, having received eight interview offers in a week after sending out his resume. The prospect of landing a higher-paying job keeps him hopeful of moving out of the slum district soon. The sooner the better.","role":"system"},{"content":"Who is the article about?","role":"user"},{"content":"Yang Hongwei","role":"assistant"},{"content":"How does he travel to and from work?","role":"user"},{"content":"the bus","role":"assistant"},{"content":"What have migrants come to be called?","role":"user"},{"content":"the \"ant tribe\"","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Who created this term?","role":"user"},{"content":"Chinese sociologists","role":"assistant"},{"content":"How many of them graduated from famous universities?","role":"user"},{"content":"nearly 30 percent","role":"assistant"},{"content":"What percentage had incomes that didn't meet expectations?","role":"user"},{"content":"66 percent","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Who predicted an increasingly challenging job market?","role":"user"},{"content":"Lian Si","role":"assistant"},{"content":"How many are in Beijing alone?","role":"user"},{"content":"about 100,000","role":"assistant"},{"content":"How much did Yang's room cost?","role":"user"},{"content":"550 yuan (81 US dollars)","role":"assistant"},{"content":"How much of his salary was this amount?","role":"user"},{"content":"about one-fifth","role":"assistant"}]}

She imparted her projects without delay to Lucretia, who received them in a different spirit from that in which they were communicated. Lucretia bore as little resemblance to her step-mother in character, as in person. If she did not possess her beauty, she was born with an intellect of far greater capacity and reach. She had a deep judgment. A hasty alliance with a youth, arranged by their mutual relatives, might suit very well the clime and manners of Italy, but Lucretia was well aware that it was altogether opposed to the habits and feelings of this country. She had no conviction that either Coningsby would wish to marry her, or, if willing, that his grandfather would sanction such a step in one as yet only on the threshold of the world. Lucretia therefore received the suggestions and proposals of Madarne Colonna with coldness and indifference; one might even say contempt, for she neither felt respect for this lady, nor was she sedulous to evince it. Although really younger than Coningsby, Lucretia felt that a woman of eighteen is, in all worldly considerations, ten years older than a youth of the same age. She anticipated that a considerable time might elapse before Coningsby would feel it necessary to seal his destiny by marriage, while, on the other hand, she was not only anxious, but resolved, not to delay on her part her emancipation from the galling position in which she very frequently found herself.

Here let's know some of them. Faye Wong and her husband Li Yapeng started the Yan Ran Angel Foundation for harelipped children three years ago. It was named after their daughter. Its purpose is to help children under 14 to cure their harelips. The couple donated one million yuan (about $ 133,000) to start the organization. Cong Fei was born in a poor family. He became a successful singer in Shenzhen. He helped 178 poor students and disabled people for more than 10 years. Before he died of an illness at the age of 37 in 2006, he decided to donate his cornea to people with eye problems. He helped six people see the world. Guan Mucun has donated money to Project Hope to help poor students finish primary education. Thirty of these poor students have already finished high school with her support. Guan has also helped with charity work for environment protection, HIV\/AIDS prevention, blood donation and \"Mother Water\". Guan had an unlucky childhood: her mother died when she was only 10 years old. With the help of the government and her neighbours, she grew up and was successful as a famous singer. Action star Jackie Chan is a wholehearted supporter of charities including UNICEF, Operation Smile and his own Jackie Chan Charitable Foundation. In 2007, he used much of his spare time to visit the farthest parts of China on his Dragon's Heart Charity Missions. The Dragon's Heart Foundation aims to meet the needs of poor children and the elderly in the hardest-to-reach areas of the country. Chan has made several trips to these poor villages, bringing warm clothing, wheelchairs and school supplies, and helping to build schools.","role":"system"},{"content":"what organization did Faye Wong start with her husband?","role":"user"},{"content":"Yan Ran Angel Foundation","role":"assistant"},{"content":"what was it named after?","role":"user"},{"content":"their daughter","role":"assistant"},{"content":"does it help children over 14?","role":"user"},{"content":"no","role":"assistant"},{"content":"what does it help children under 14 with?","role":"user"},{"content":"harelips","role":"assistant"},{"content":"what is the name of Jackie Chan's charitable organization?","role":"user"},{"content":"Jackie Chan Charitable Foundation","role":"assistant"},{"content":"does he support other charities?","role":"user"},{"content":"yes","role":"assistant"},{"content":"when did he go on the Dragon's Hearth Charity Missions?","role":"user"},{"content":"In 2007","role":"assistant"},{"content":"how old was Guan when her mother died?","role":"user"},{"content":"10","role":"assistant"},{"content":"which project did she donate money to?","role":"user"},{"content":"Project Hope","role":"assistant"},{"content":"who does that help?","role":"user"},{"content":"poor students","role":"assistant"},{"content":"how many have finished school because of this?","role":"user"},{"content":"Thirty","role":"assistant"},{"content":"was cong fei rich?","role":"user"},{"content":"Not untill later in life","role":"assistant"},{"content":"what was his profession?","role":"user"},{"content":"a singer","role":"assistant"},{"content":"how old was he when he died?","role":"user"},{"content":"37","role":"assistant"},{"content":"how many people did he help with eye problems?","role":"user"},{"content":"six","role":"assistant"},{"content":"what did he donate to people with eye problems?","role":"user"},{"content":"his cornea","role":"assistant"},{"content":"how much in total did Faye Wong and her husband donate to start their organization?","role":"user"},{"content":"one million yuan (about $ 133,000)","role":"assistant"},{"content":"where was Cong Fei a famous singer?","role":"user"},{"content":"Shenzhen","role":"assistant"},{"content":"who else grew up as a successful singer?","role":"user"},{"content":"Guan Mucun","role":"assistant"},{"content":"what did Jackie Chan bring to the villages?","role":"user"},{"content":"warm clothing, wheelchairs and school supplies","role":"assistant"}]}

Musicians use the guitar for almost all kinds of music. Country and western music would not be the same without a guitar. The traditional Spanish folk music called Flamenco could not exist without a guitar. The sound of American blues music would not be the same without the sad cry of the guitar. And rock and roll music would almost be impossible without this instrument. \n\nMusic experts do not agree about where the guitar was first played. Most agree it is ancient. Some experts say an instrument very much like a guitar was played in Egypt more than 1,000 years ago. Most experts say that the ancestor of the modern guitar was brought to Spain from Persia sometime in the 12thcentury. The guitar continued to develop in Spain. In the 1700s it became similar to the instrument we know today. \n\nMany famous musicians played the instrument. The famous Italian violins Niccole Paganism played and wrote music for the guitar in the early 1800s. Franz Schubert used the guitar to write some of his famous works. In modern times Spanish guitarist Andres Segovia helped make the instrument extremely popular. \n\nIn the 1930s, Les Paul began experimenting to make an electric guitar. He invented the solid-bodied electric guitar in 1946. The Gibson Guitar Company began producing its famous Les Paul Guitar in 1952. It became a powerful influence on popular music. The instrument has the same shape and the same six strings as the traditional guitar, but it sounds very different. Les Paul produced a series of extremely popular recordings that introduced the public to this music. Listen to this Les Paul recording. It was the fifth most popular song in the United States in 1952. It is called \"Meet Mister Callaghan.\"","role":"system"},{"content":"What muscial instrument is being talked about here?","role":"user"},{"content":"the guitar","role":"assistant"},{"content":"What kind of music you usually hear a guitar?","role":"user"},{"content":"all kinds of music","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Where was it first played?","role":"user"},{"content":"Egypt","role":"assistant"},{"content":"What about the modern guitar?","role":"user"},{"content":"Spain","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Did any famous muscians play the guitar in those times?","role":"user"},{"content":"yes","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Who?","role":"user"},{"content":"Niccole Paganism","role":"assistant"},{"content":"When was the electric guitar famous?","role":"user"},{"content":"1952","role":"assistant"},{"content":"who was les paul","role":"user"},{"content":"A guitar player","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Did he use a special guitar?","role":"user"},{"content":"Yes","role":"assistant"},{"content":"What did it look like","role":"user"},{"content":"Like a traditional guitar?","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Did Les have any popular songs?","role":"user"},{"content":"Yes","role":"assistant"}]}

This was no \"Perry Mason,\" or even \"The Defenders.\" \n\nBochco being Bochco, the hard stuff was paired with moments of silly humor and steamy sex (or silly sex and steamy humor), making for a high-wire balance of drama and comedy. \n\nOne first-season episode got people talking about a fictional sex act called the \"Venus Butterfly\"; later, the show actually killed off a character by dropping her down an elevator shaft. \n\nThe big hair and big-shouldered suits of the '80s may be gone, but the show remains influential.

James succeeded to the Scottish throne at the age of thirteen months, after his mother Mary was compelled to abdicate in his favour. Four different regents governed during his minority, which ended officially in 1578, though he did not gain full control of his government until 1583. In 1603, he succeeded the last Tudor monarch of England and Ireland, Elizabeth I, who died without issue. He continued to reign in all three kingdoms for 22 years, a period known after him as the Jacobean era, until his death in 1625 at the age of 58. After the Union of the Crowns, he based himself in England (the largest of the three realms) from 1603, only returning to Scotland once in 1617, and styled himself \"King of Great Britain and Ireland\".

It is the world's second largest and second highest valued semiconductor chip makers based on revenue after being overtaken by Samsung, and is the inventor of the x86 series of microprocessors, the processors found in most personal computers (PCs). Intel supplies processors for computer system manufacturers such as Apple, Lenovo, HP, and Dell. Intel also manufactures motherboard chipsets, network interface controllers and integrated circuits, flash memory, graphics chips, embedded processors and other devices related to communications and computing. \n\nIntel Corporation was founded on July 18, 1968, by semiconductor pioneers Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore, and widely associated with the executive leadership and vision of Andrew Grove. The company's name was conceived as portmanteau of the words \"int\"egrated and \"el\"ectronics, with co-founder Noyce having been a key inventor of the integrated circuit (microchip). The fact that \"intel\" is the term for intelligence information also made the name appropriate. Intel was an early developer of SRAM and DRAM memory chips, which represented the majority of its business until 1981. Although Intel created the world's first commercial microprocessor chip in 1971, it was not until the success of the personal computer (PC) that this became its primary business. During the 1990s, Intel invested heavily in new microprocessor designs fostering the rapid growth of the computer industry. During this period Intel became the dominant supplier of microprocessors for PCs and was known for aggressive and anti-competitive tactics in defense of its market position, particularly against Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), as well as a struggle with Microsoft for control over the direction of the PC industry.","role":"system"},{"content":"What is the subject of the article?","role":"user"},{"content":"Details about Intel Corporation","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Where is the company's headquarters?","role":"user"},{"content":"Santa Clara, California","role":"assistant"},{"content":"ALso known as?","role":"user"},{"content":"Silicon Valley","role":"assistant"},{"content":"What did Intel invent?","role":"user"},{"content":"x86 series of microprocessors, the processors found in most personal computers (PCs).","role":"assistant"},{"content":"When was Intel founded?","role":"user"},{"content":"July 18, 1968","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Name one founder.","role":"user"},{"content":"Robert Noyce","role":"assistant"},{"content":"And the other?","role":"user"},{"content":"Gordon Moore","role":"assistant"},{"content":"What two words were used to make the company's name?","role":"user"},{"content":"\"int\"egrated and \"el\"ectronics","role":"assistant"},{"content":"What did Intel make the world's first of?","role":"user"},{"content":"commercial microprocessor chip","role":"assistant"},{"content":"When?","role":"user"},{"content":"1971","role":"assistant"}]}

The French promoted the rights of Catholics, while Russia promoted those of the Eastern Orthodox Christians. The longer-term causes involved the decline of the Ottoman Empire and the unwillingness of the United Kingdom and France to allow Russia to gain territory and power at Ottoman expense.

Nicholas issued an ultimatum that the Orthodox subjects of the Empire be placed under his protection. Britain attempted to mediate, and arranged a compromise that Nicholas agreed to.

In a religious sense, the Islamic Ummah refers to those who adhere to the teachings of Islam, referred to as Muslims. In a cultural sense, the Muslim Ummah refers to Islamic civilization, exclusive of non-Muslims living in that civilization. In a modern geopolitical sense, the term \"Islamic Nation\" usually refers collectively to Muslim-majority countries, states, districts, or towns. \n\nThe Islamic Golden Age coincided with the Middle Ages in the Muslim world, starting with the rise of Islam and establishment of the first Islamic state in 622. The end of the age is variously given as 1258 with the Mongolian Sack of Baghdad, or 1492 with the completion of the Christian Reconquista of the Emirate of Granada in Al-Andalus, Iberian Peninsula. During the reign of the Abbasid caliph Harun ar-Rashid (786 to 809), the legendary House of Wisdom was inaugurated in Baghdad where scholars from various parts of the world sought to translate and gather all the known world's knowledge into Arabic. The Abbasids were influenced by the Quranic injunctions and hadiths, such as \"the ink of a scholar is more holy than the blood of a martyr,\" that stressed the value of knowledge. The major Islamic capital cities of Baghdad, Cairo, and C\u00f3rdoba became the main intellectual centers for science, philosophy, medicine, and education.

With a population of approximately 3.7 million, Berlin is the second most populous city proper in the European Union and the seventh most populous urban area in the European Union. Located in northeastern Germany on the banks of the rivers Spree and Havel, it is the centre of the Berlin-Brandenburg Metropolitan Region, which has roughly 6 million residents from more than 180 nations. Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. Around one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers, canals and lakes. \n\nFirst documented in the 13th century and situated at the crossing of two important historic trade routes, Berlin became the capital of the Margraviate of Brandenburg (14171701), the Kingdom of Prussia (1701\u20131918), the German Empire (1871\u20131918), the Weimar Republic (1919\u20131933) and the Third Reich (1933\u20131945). Berlin in the 1920s was the third largest municipality in the world. After World War II and its subsequent occupation by the victorious countries, the city was divided; East Berlin was declared capital of East Germany, while West Berlin became a de facto West German exclave, surrounded by the Berlin Wall (1961\u20131989) and East German territory.

THE LAST JACOBITE RISING. \n\nWhile the Kirk was vainly striving to assuage the tempers of Mr Erskine and his friends, the Jacobites were preparing to fish in troubled waters. In 1739 Walpole was forced to declare war against Spain, and Walpole had previously sounded James as to his own chances of being trusted by that exiled prince. James thought that Walpole was merely angling for information. Meanwhile Jacobite affairs were managed by two rivals, Macgregor (calling himself Drummond) of Balhaldy and Murray of Broughton. The sanguine Balhaldy induced France to suppose that the Jacobites in England and Scotland were much more united, powerful, and ready for action than they really were, when Argyll left office in 1742, while Walpole fell from power, Carteret and the Duke of Newcastle succeeding. In 1743 Murray found that France, though now at war with England over the Spanish Succession, was holding aloof from the Jacobite cause, though plied with flourishing and fabulous reports from Balhaldy and the Jacobite Lord Sempill. But, in December 1743, on the strength of alleged Jacobite energy in England, Balhaldy obtained leave from France to visit Rome and bring Prince Charles. The Prince had kept himself in training for war and was eager. Taking leave of his father for the last time, Charles drove out of Rome on January 9, 1744; evaded, in disguise, every trap that was set for him, and landed at Antibes, reaching Paris on February 10. Louis did not receive him openly, if he received him at all; the Prince lurked at Gravelines in disguise, with the Earl Marischal, while winds and waves half ruined, and the approach of a British fleet drove into port, a French fleet of invasion under Roqueville (March 6, 7, 1744).

It is to be distinguished from \"musical form\" and \"musical style\", although in practice these terms are sometimes used interchangeably. Recently, academics have argued that categorizing music by genre is inaccurate and outdated. \n\nMusic can be divided into different genres in many different ways. The artistic nature of music means that these classifications are often subjective and controversial, and some genres may overlap. There are even varying academic definitions of the term \"genre \"itself. In his book \"Form in Tonal Music\", Douglass M. Green distinguishes between genre and form. He lists madrigal, motet, canzona, ricercar, and dance as examples of genres from the Renaissance period. To further clarify the meaning of \"genre\", Green writes, \"Beethoven's Op. 61 and Mendelssohn's Op. 64 are identical in genre \u2013 both are violin concertos \u2013 but different in form. However, Mozart's Rondo for Piano, K. 511, and the \"Agnus Dei\" from his Mass, K. 317 are quite different in genre but happen to be similar in form.\" Some, like Peter van der Merwe, treat the terms \"genre\" and \"style\" as the same, saying that \"genre\" should be defined as pieces of music that share a certain style or \"basic musical language.\" Others, such as Allan F. Moore, state that \"genre\" and \"style\" are two separate terms, and that secondary characteristics such as subject matter can also differentiate between genres. A music genre or subgenre may also be defined by the musical techniques, the style, the cultural context, and the content and spirit of the themes. Geographical origin is sometimes used to identify a music genre, though a single geographical category will often include a wide variety of subgenres. Timothy Laurie argues that since the early 1980s, \"genre has graduated from being a subset of popular music studies to being an almost ubiquitous framework for constituting and evaluating musical research objects\".","role":"system"},{"content":"What is music often divided into?","role":"user"},{"content":"different genres","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Are these objective categorizations?","role":"user"},{"content":"no","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Is there distinct boundaries between all genres?","role":"user"},{"content":"no","role":"assistant"},{"content":"What did Green publish?","role":"user"},{"content":"\"Form in Tonal Music\"","role":"assistant"},{"content":"How many categories of Renassiance music did he list?","role":"user"},{"content":"Five","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Is dance one of those?","role":"user"},{"content":"yes","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Did he argue that genre and form were essentially the same?","role":"user"},{"content":"no","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Which pieces did he argue with the same genre but had different forms?","role":"user"},{"content":"Beethoven's Op. 61 and Mendelssohn's Op. 64","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Which works were examples of the exact opposite of that?","role":"user"},{"content":"Mozart's Rondo for Piano, K. 511, and the \"Agnus Dei\" from his Mass, K. 317","role":"assistant"},{"content":"What genre would The Beethoven and Mendelssohn pieces be listed as?","role":"user"},{"content":"concertos","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Do van der Merwe and Moore argue the same point?","role":"user"},{"content":"no","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Which one of them thinks genre and style are the same?","role":"user"},{"content":"Peter van der Merwe","role":"assistant"},{"content":"How does he define it?","role":"user"},{"content":"as pieces of music that share a certain style","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Is musical technique one way define a genre?","role":"user"},{"content":"yes","role":"assistant"},{"content":"What is another?","role":"user"},{"content":"the style","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Is geographical origin ever used?","role":"user"},{"content":"yes","role":"assistant"},{"content":"What is one issue with that?","role":"user"},{"content":"a single geographical category will often include a wide variety of subgenres","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Who said that the term has graduated from being a subset of popular music studies?","role":"user"},{"content":"Timothy Laurie","role":"assistant"},{"content":"What type of framework has it become in his opinion?","role":"user"},{"content":"for constituting and evaluating musical research objects","role":"assistant"},{"content":"What do recent academics think  about this type of categorization?","role":"user"},{"content":"that it is inaccurate and outdated","role":"assistant"}]}

Ibn Rushd was born in C\u00f3rdoba, Al Andalus (present-day Spain), and died at Marrakesh in present-day Morocco. His body was interred in his family tomb at C\u00f3rdoba. The 13th-century philosophical movement in Latin Christian and Jewish tradition based on Ibn Rushd's work is called Averroism. \n\nIbn Rushd was a defender of Aristotelian philosophy against Ash'ari theologians led by Al-Ghazali. Although highly regarded as a legal scholar of the Maliki school of Islamic law, Ibn Rushd's philosophical ideas were considered controversial in Ash'arite Muslim circles. Whereas al-Ghazali believed that any individual act of a natural phenomenon occurred only because God willed it to happen, Ibn Rushd insisted phenomena followed natural laws that God created. \n\nIbn Rushd had a greater impact on Christian Europe, being known by the \"the Commentator\" for his detailed emendations to Aristotle. Latin translations of Ibn Rushd's work led the way to the popularization of Aristotle.","role":"system"},{"content":"Where was Rushd born?","role":"user"},{"content":"C\u00f3rdoba, Al Andalus","role":"assistant"},{"content":"In what country is this today?","role":"user"},{"content":"Spain","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Where did he die?","role":"user"},{"content":"Marrakesh","role":"assistant"},{"content":"In what modern place?","role":"user"},{"content":"Morocco","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Where was he laid to rest?","role":"user"},{"content":"In his family tomb at C\u00f3rdoba.","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Who was Rushd?","role":"user"},{"content":"A medieval Andalusian polymath","role":"assistant"},{"content":"What is one subject he wrote on?","role":"user"},{"content":"logic","role":"assistant"},{"content":"And another?","role":"user"},{"content":"theology","role":"assistant"},{"content":"And another?","role":"user"},{"content":"geography","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Did he also write about the study of stars?","role":"user"},{"content":"yes","role":"assistant"},{"content":"When was he born?","role":"user"},{"content":"14 April 1126","role":"assistant"},{"content":"When did he die?","role":"user"},{"content":"10 December 1198","role":"assistant"},{"content":"What did he defend?","role":"user"},{"content":"Aristotelian philosophy","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Against whom?","role":"user"},{"content":"against Ash'ari theologians","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Who was their leader?","role":"user"},{"content":"Al-Ghazali","role":"assistant"},{"content":"By what title was Rushd known in Europe?","role":"user"},{"content":"\"the Commentator\"","role":"assistant"},{"content":"For what?","role":"user"},{"content":"His emendations to Aristotle.","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Did his work make Aristotle better known?","role":"user"},{"content":"yes","role":"assistant"},{"content":"True or False: Rushd believed everything happened by the direct will of God.","role":"user"},{"content":"False.","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Who did?","role":"user"},{"content":"al-Ghazali","role":"assistant"}]}

Omaha is located in the Midwestern United States on the Missouri River, about north of the mouth of the Platte River. Omaha is the anchor of the Omaha-Council Bluffs metropolitan area, which includes Council Bluffs, Iowa, across the Missouri River from Omaha. According to the 2010 census, Omaha's population was 408,958, making it the nation's 44th-largest city; this had increased to 446,970 as of a 2016 estimate. Including its suburbs, Omaha formed the 60th-largest metropolitan area in the United States in 2013, with an estimated population of 895,151 residing in eight counties. The Omaha-Council Bluffs-Fremont, Nebraska-IA Combined Statistical Area is 931,667, according to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2013 estimate. Nearly 1.3 million people reside within the Greater Omaha area, comprising a 50-mile (80\u00a0km) radius of Downtown Omaha, the city's center. \n\nOmaha's pioneer period began in 1854, when the city was founded by speculators from neighboring Council Bluffs, Iowa. The city was founded along the Missouri River, and a crossing called Lone Tree Ferry earned the city its nickname, the \"Gateway to the West\". Omaha introduced this new West to the world in 1898, when it played host to the World's Fair, dubbed the Trans-Mississippi Exposition. During the 19th century, Omaha's central location in the United States spurred the city to become an important national transportation hub. Throughout the rest of the 19th century, the transportation and jobbing sectors were important in the city, along with its railroads and breweries. In the 20th century, the Omaha Stockyards, once the world's largest, and its meatpacking plants gained international prominence.","role":"system"},{"content":"Who started Omaha?","role":"user"},{"content":"speculators","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Where were they from?","role":"user"},{"content":"Council Bluffs","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Is that in Nebraska?","role":"user"},{"content":"No","role":"assistant"},{"content":"What state?","role":"user"},{"content":"Iowa","role":"assistant"},{"content":"When did this occur?","role":"user"},{"content":"1854","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Is it on the Mississippi River?","role":"user"},{"content":"No","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Which river?","role":"user"},{"content":"the Missouri River","role":"assistant"},{"content":"What was the city known as?","role":"user"},{"content":"the Gateway to the West","role":"assistant"},{"content":"What happened there in 1898?","role":"user"},{"content":"the World's Fair","role":"assistant"},{"content":"What was the event called?","role":"user"},{"content":"the Trans-Mississippi Exposition","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Is Omaha near the middle of the country?","role":"user"},{"content":"Midwestern","role":"assistant"},{"content":"What happened because of its central location?","role":"user"},{"content":"it became a national transportation hub","role":"assistant"},{"content":"If I were a brew master would Omaha have been a good place for me?","role":"user"},{"content":"Yes","role":"assistant"},{"content":"What else was it known for in the 1900s?","role":"user"},{"content":"railroads","role":"assistant"},{"content":"How many cities in Nebraska are larger than Omaha?","role":"user"},{"content":"none","role":"assistant"},{"content":"What county is it a part of?","role":"user"},{"content":"Douglas County","role":"assistant"},{"content":"What metropolitan area does it belong to?","role":"user"},{"content":"Omaha-Council Bluffs","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Does that include parts of a different state?","role":"user"},{"content":"Yes","role":"assistant"},{"content":"What was its population in 2010?","role":"user"},{"content":"408,958","role":"assistant"}]}
